### Programmingproject proposal

### **Introduction**
On the 7th of january 2019, I had a conversation with minor coordinator Martijn Stegeman. We discussed that I'll be doing another project between february and june 2019. This project wil differ from the original project. It will be made using Processing (which is build upon Java) and with Arduino. In this proposal I'll give an overview of my plans.


### **The project**
I've been thinking quite some time about what kind of project I want to do for this programmingproject. I wanted to understand the fundamentals of Processing, but I came to the conclusion that understanding the fundamentals of Processing entails understanding Java. I've spent a month learning Processing and I think I got the hang of it now. I like the fact that Processing enables you to make your creations interactive, that it incorporates the user in the program. This, to me, is a pretty exciting feature. But what's even more exciting is that there is a platform that enables you to make things move in **real life**. Make it interactive in a physical environment, so that the user can touch and even influence it. 
This platform is called Arduino. It is a microcontroller on which you can build circuits and interfaces for interactive projects. It is programmable and also has a library that works with Processing. 

For this project, I'd like to get a thorough understanding of Arduino and Processing. To achieve this, I want to make at least **two** projects, which I call 'sketches' from now on. By the end, I'll have two or three of sketches and hopefully a complete understanding of the Arduino platform ánd Processing. 


### **What will these sketches look like?**
The first two weeks I'll be spending practicing the basics of Arduino and building electroninc circuits. I will use the Arduino Projects Book: [https://bastiaanvanhengel.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/arduino_projects_book.pdf] and the Arduino Cookbook: [https://www.elektor.nl/arduino-cookbook?gclid=CjwKCAiAkrTjBRAoEiwAXpf9CeLkqyIwT8gDWaTwTKv-KPNfdHclsN7lRe55W40SSFuvKonU54BIVxoCw20QAvD_BwE]

After that, I will start making the different sketches. For these sketches I want to use everyday products and turn them into something surprising. 

When something is old we normally throw it immediately away. I think that's a pity sometimes. What if I can make it into something 'fun'? I want to transform products that otherwise would end up being garbage into funny, interactive objects.


### **Difficulties**
There are tons of difficulties in these sketches. How will I connect everything with each other? Will I succeed in hacking the everyday products? How will they be able to talk with my Arduino and Processing sketches? These are all questions that come to mind. Luckily, I have people who can help me with, for example hacking everyday projects. This is called 'circuit bending'. The programming is something that I can do completely on my own. 
The sketches are quite experimental and I don't know if I will succeed, but at least I want to try it. That's what this is about; trying. If I don't succeed, I have the option of doing a retake in june and just make three data visualizations in JavaScript. There is also perhaps a possibility to do a retake at my own academy. But since I really want to get started incorporating Arduino in my work, I want to try to make this a success.


### **Solution and necessities**
First and foremost, I need to Arduino library for Processing. I already have that installed. Secondly I need to dive into building electrical circuits. I do have a workshop at my school where I can freely use electrical components and ask for help with these kind of projects. I need different kinds of sensors, which are also available at my academies workshop.
