### Programmingproject proposal

#### Introduction
On the 7th of january 2019, I had a conversation with minor coordinator Martijn Stegeman. We discussed that I'll be doing another project between february and june 2019. This project wil differ from the original project. It will be made using processing (which is build upon Java) and perhaps with Arduino. In this proposal I'll give an overview of my plans.


#### The project
I've got several ideas of what I'd like to make for my final project. I've got three ideas listed down below. 

- The idea that appeals the most to me is the following; I would like to make an interactive installation with a friend of mine who is very good at playing (bass)guitar. I would like to connect his guitar to an Arduino board. I have to turn this Arduino controller into an MIDI receiver. With the MIDI data I receive, I'd like to generate live images. These images are based on what he's playing on his guitar. Since I haven't worked with Arduino so much, I have to dicuss the feasbility of this project with my tech assistent from my own school, St. Joost.

- If this project doesn't succeed or if it's too difficult, I'd like to make an interactive website containing two or three visualizations made in Processing. These visualizations are based on the real world. Therefore, I have to built my own 'physics engine'. I have to take into account what forces exist in the real world, like gravity, air resistance, etc... I cannot say what these visualizations will look like yet, that is something that I'll discover along the way. What I do know is that they will be interactive, meaning that the user can influence the environments by for example clicking/dragging the mouse. 

- Lastly, I would like to make a program that generates 'art'. This is ofcourse very broad defined. Since I can't draw a very beautiful picture myself, I'd like my program to do it for me. For example a program that generates posters/graphic design. The user can specify which colors he/she wants to use. The program then generates a poster based on these specifications. It is semi random. It will consist of shapes and colors.


#### Comparison and difficulties
The second project is more likely to succeed because I can use a lot of things that I learned during the courses 'fulltime programmeren 1 & 2' and 'heuristieken'. The third project is still a little bit vague, but a lot of people have made generative art so you can find a lot about it on the internet. The first project definitely is the most challenging, because I haven't worked with Arduino so much. I'd have to dive into this and also into the hardware part of this project. How do I connect a guitar to an microcontroller like Arduino? After that, I have to turn the MIDI data into something useful/beautiful. It definitely is challening, but also interesting. 


#### Solution
For project 1: As metioned above, I'd like to make an installation. The bassplayer is standing in a room. His guitar is attached to a microcontroller. This microcontroller is turned into a MIDI receiver. The data which is received is turned into live images. A very simple example will be: if the bassplayer plays the note 'A', the image will turn red. These images are projected behind the bassplayer.

For project 2: I want to make visualizations simulating the real world. A simplified example would be: a ball falling down the sky, landing in water. First it experiences gravity, air resistance, its own mass... If it lands in water, it experiences the force of water. How can I make a realistic and visual appealing visualization of things like this? Furthermore, the user has to be able to influence the visualization. For example: click the mouse and the wind will start to blow. 

For project 3: I would like to make a program that creates graphic designs. It takes in 'constraints' given by the user. For example: only use red, blue and pink. With these constraints, it creates graphic designs.
