# Style guide

## Indentation
- Four spaces are used for one indent

## White lines
- White lines are used to sepereate different variables and functions.

## Comments
- After every function declaration, a comment on what the function does follows. 
- Additional comments are written when necessary.

## Variable names
- Variable names describe in short what the function/variable does or is. Besides from using variable name 'i' in an iteration, 
no other one-letter variables are used.
- Before every variable, there is 'var'.

## Functions
- The aim is to write functions that do only one thing. If not, the function does things that belong to eachother.

## Semicolons
- Semicolons are used in a consistent way.
