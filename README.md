### Programmingproject proposal

#### **Introduction**
On the 7th of january 2019, I had a conversation with minor coordinator Martijn Stegeman. We discussed that I'll be doing another project between february and june 2019. This project wil differ from the original project. It will be made using Processing (which is build upon Java) and with Arduino. In this proposal I'll give an overview of my plans.


#### **The project**
I've been thinking quite some time about what kind of project I want to do for this programmingproject. I wanted to understand the fundamentals of Processing, but I came to the conclusion that understanding the fundamentals of Processing entails understanding Java. I've spent a month learning Processing and I think I got the hang of it now. I like the fact that Processing enables you to make your creations interactive, that it incorporates the user in the program. This, to me, is a pretty exciting feature. But what's even more exciting is that there is a platform that enables you to make things move in **real life**. Make it interactive in a physical environment, so that the user can touch and even influence it. 
This platform is called Arduino. It is a microcontroller on which you can build circuits and interfaces for interactive projects. It is programmable and also has a library that works with Processing. 

For this project, I'd like to get a thorough understanding of Arduino. To achieve this, I want to make at least **two** projects, which I call 'sketches' from now on. By the end, I'll have two or three of sketches and hopefully a complete understanding of the Arduino platform ánd Processing. For now, I have some ideas for sketches which I list down below. Some simple, some more complex. I don't know which I will make yet. I will figure that out in consultation with my tech assistant.


- **What will these sketches look like?**
The first two weeks I'll be spending practicing the basics of Arduino and building electroninc circuits. I will use the Arduino Projects Book: [https://bastiaanvanhengel.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/arduino_projects_book.pdf] and the Arduino Cookbook: [https://www.elektor.nl/arduino-cookbook?gclid=CjwKCAiAkrTjBRAoEiwAXpf9CeLkqyIwT8gDWaTwTKv-KPNfdHclsN7lRe55W40SSFuvKonU54BIVxoCw20QAvD_BwE]

After that, I will start making the different sketches. For these sketches I want to use everyday products and turn them into something surprising. 

Problem statement: When something is old or broke we normally throw it immediately away. I think that's a pity sometimes. What if I can make it into something 'fun'? I want to transform products that otherwise would end up being garbage into funny, interactive objects.

Example 1: The kiwi razor. 
Problem statement: I belong to the rare group of people that eat their kiwis with the peel still on it. The kiwi gold is perfect: it comes with a smooth and soft skin. No hairs, just softness. But you are not always in the posession of a gold kiwi, sometimes you get a green one. These ones come with a slightly hairier skin. Therefore, I'd like to have a kiwi razor. 
It will consists out of a spinning pole, with on the top the kiwi. Next to the pole is a moving arm with at the end a razorblade. If the user passes a specific border, a spot will light up and the kiwi razor will be visible. 

Example 2: Collecting weather data from a specific date over 5 years. (A weather installation)
Problem statement: Over the years I did a good job at collecting fans. I don't know why, but everytime I moved into a new house, people left their fans. For this sketch, I want to collect weather data from a specific date over 5 to 10 years. Not just weather data, but data about the wind power and amount of sunshine in particular. The user can choose a year from a menu. According to the weather data from this day, the fans will start to blow and a lamp will start to shine (or not). If the wind power was very strong at, for example 11th february 1997, the fans will create lots of wind. Nice to have would be if I add a variable 'rain' as well and make a Processing sketch of rain falling down. Ofcourse, it needs to look realistic.

Example 3: A swarm of bees and a bottle of pesticide. 
Problem statement: The bee is an endangered species. If they will go to extinct, it will be a great loss for the bees themself, but also for us. I want to make a suggestion of a swarm of bees. My weapon of choice in this case would be electric toothbrushes. In the beginning you will here a cacophony of buzzing. The bees are vibrant and loud. When time passes and more pesticide is released, the buzzing slowly stops.

Example 4: A paper dispenser and a tree.
For this project I'd like to use a paper dispenser. Next to it, there is (a virtual) tree. If the user walks past the paper dispenser, the tree collapses a bit. 

#### **Difficulties**
There are tons of difficulties in these sketches. How will I connect everything with eachother? Will I succeed in hacking the everyday products? How will they be able to talk with my Arduino and Processing sketches? These are all questions that come to mind. Luckily, I have people who can help me with, for example hacking everyday projects. This is called 'circuit bending'. The programming is something that I can do completely on my own. 
The sketches are quite experimental and I don't know if I will succeed, but at least I want to try it. That's what this is about; trying. If I don't succeed, I have the option of doing a retake in june and just make three data visualizations in JavaScript. There is also perhaps a possibility to do a retake at my own academy. But since I really want to get started incorporating Arduino in my work, I want to try to make this a success.


#### **Solution and necessities**
First and foremost, I need to Arduino library for Processing. I already have that installed. Secondly I need to dive into building electrical circuits. I do have a workshop at my school where I can freely use electrical components and ask for help with these kind of projects.
