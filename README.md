I had a conversation with Martijn Stegeman and we discussed that I'll be doing my project between february and june 2019. This project wil differ from the original project. It will probably not be made with javascript and d3, but with processing.
The next three weeks, I'll be working on my new proposal and will submit this as soon as it's finished.
